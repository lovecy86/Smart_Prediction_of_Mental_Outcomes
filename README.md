# **Smart Prediction of Mental Health: Sentiment Analysis Model**

## **Project Overview**

The **Smart Prediction of Mental Health** project aims to build a **Sentiment Analysis Model** that predicts mental health outcomes based on lifestyle factors, social dynamics, and personal history. The model’s objective is to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers and employers to help identify individuals at risk of mental health issues and offer tailored support.

By analyzing the relationship between various lifestyle changes (e.g., days spent indoors), social influences (e.g., family history), and occupation, this project offers a predictive tool to forecast mental health conditions like stress, mood swings, and treatment needs.

## **Dataset**

This project uses the **Mental Health Dataset** available on Kaggle. The dataset contains various attributes related to an individual’s lifestyle, social history, and mental health status.

- **Dataset URL**: [Mental Health Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divaniazzahra/mental-health-dataset)

The dataset includes features such as:
- **Days spent indoors**
- **Family history of mental health issues**
- **Occupation**
- **Social and personal history**
- **Mental health status**

## **Project Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** that can predict mental health outcomes using the dataset’s features. The specific goals include:

1. **Correlating lifestyle factors** (e.g., days spent indoors) with growing stress and mood swings.
2. **Identifying the influence** of family history of mental health issues on coping mechanisms and mood fluctuations, segmented by gender and occupation.
3. **Predicting the likelihood** of requiring mental health treatment or experiencing social weakness based on demographic and lifestyle features.

## **Stakeholders**

- **Healthcare Providers**: Psychologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners who can use the predictive insights for early intervention.
- **HR Departments and Employers**: Organizations can utilize the model to detect employees experiencing mental stress, ensuring they receive timely support.
- **Mental Health Advocacy Groups**: Organizations focused on raising awareness and providing resources to improve mental health in the workplace and at home.

## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identify the most relevant features that impact mental health outcomes, such as social history, occupation, and stress indicators.
- **Data Transformation**: Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding and normalize numerical features for optimal model performance.

### **2. Model Development**

- **Model Selection**: Evaluate various machine learning algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** for their effectiveness in predicting mental health outcomes.
- **Model Training**: Split the data into training and testing sets, train the models, and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model parameters to improve prediction accuracy and minimize overfitting.

### **3. Model Evaluation**

- **Performance Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance**: Use model explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to understand the impact of individual features on predictions.

### **4. Flask Deployment**

- The final model will be deployed as a **Flask web application**. This allows healthcare providers and employers to input real-time data and get predictions on mental health outcomes.

#### **Flask Application Endpoints**
- **POST /predict**: Accepts user input data (lifestyle, social history, etc.) and returns the predicted mental health outcome (e.g., stress, mood swings, treatment need).

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation.
  - **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
  - **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest** for classification.
  - **Flask** for web deployment.
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data visualization.

## **Installation and Setup**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. Then, install the required libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

To run the Flask application locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be hosted on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` where you can interact with the model.

## **Cloud Deployment on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk)**

### **Set Up AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

1. **Sign Up for AWS**: If you don't have an AWS account, create one at [AWS](https://www.aws.amazon.com/).
2. **Install AWS CLI**: Download and install the AWS CLI from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
3. **Install Elastic Beanstalk CLI**: Follow the guide to install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI): [Elastic Beanstalk CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html).

### **Steps to Deploy on AWS**

1. **Initialize Elastic Beanstalk**:
   Inside your project folder, initialize your Elastic Beanstalk application:

   ```bash
   eb init -p python-3.x flask-app
   ```

   Replace `flask-app` with your desired app name.

2. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
   Create an environment for your app:

   ```bash
   eb create flask-app-env
   ```

   This command will create an Elastic Beanstalk environment and configure the necessary resources for hosting your app.

3. **Deploy the Application**:
   Deploy your Flask application to AWS:

   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

4. **Open the Application**:
   After deployment, you can open your app:

   ```bash
   eb open
   ```

   This will launch your Flask app hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### **Configuring the Elastic Beanstalk Environment**

Elastic Beanstalk automatically detects your Flask app and configures the environment. However, you might want to add some custom configurations:
- **Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling based on your expected traffic.
- **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables like API keys or database credentials via the AWS Management Console.

For larger applications, you may want to integrate AWS services like **RDS** for a database, **S3** for storage, or **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring.

## **Future Improvements**

1. **Integration with Wearable Devices**: Incorporate real-time health data from wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) to enhance prediction accuracy.
2. **Enhanced Explainability**: Implement more advanced model interpretability techniques, such as **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
3. **Cloud-based Data Integration**: Host the model on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and wider access, integrating with other healthcare platforms.
